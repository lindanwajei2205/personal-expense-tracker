## Features
### Logo and Navbar
The navigation bar and logo are positioned at the top of the page, offering a responsive and user-friendly design. Prioritizing a "mobile-first" approach, the navigation bar features a clickable hamburger icon with a dropdown menu on mobile devices. As the screen size increases (from tablets to laptops and beyond), the hamburger icon disappears, and the navigation bar expands to display options for navigating to different pages, including Registration/Sign Up, Login, and About. Please refer to the screenshots below for visual reference.
